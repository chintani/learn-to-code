<p>I went to the <a href='http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/quickstart/' #deploying-to-a-web-server">Quickstart page of Flask</a> and there I found the directions for my first App.</p>

<pre><code>from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, they did not quite tell me how to go about making the file since the documentation was not written for novices.</p>

<p>I remember trying to create a file in Linux a while back and it said use <em>"touch"</em> to create an empty file, so I did that and named it hello.py as it said in the instructions. Then I used <em>"pico"</em> to edit the file and typed the above code. Now it was time for me to run the code to test my Flask installation. And ...</p>

<p>Yikes!! I am getting errors. Is it because Flask did not install correctly or did I make a typo in my python file? Here is what I typed into my python file.</p>

<p>Does it look like what is typed in the code above? Well apparently I did think it was correct because I dismissed it and went on to make other decisions in trying to find out how to fix the Flask install.</p>

<p>To make a long story shorter ... there is a saying that goes like this:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A drowning man with catch at straw ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was drowning in a sea of coding ignorance and I was catching at straws ... anything to pull me out of the pit I was in, so I began looking for solutions to my <em>Flask</em> problems. </p>

<p>I was running Python 2.7.4, so I said that was my problem and upgraded to 2.7.6. Since Python was not up-to-date, maybe <em>Flask</em> did not install correctly. Went to re-install <em>Virtualenv</em> and was told by the operating system that I already had the newest version installed ... </p>

<p>Okkkk ... then it has to be <em>Flask</em> and I proceeded to re-install that. The operating system told me that the Requirement [was] already satisfied for <em>Flask Werkzeug Jinja2 itsdangerous markupsafe</em> ...say what now? But, my Hello World program was still not working??</p>

<p>So in desperation I decided to take a second look at my <em>Hello World</em> program. Huh! I see a few thing that was not right! I fixed them to arrive at this:</p>

<p>In my defense, I don't do black and white very well: words on a paper, the terminal window ... I live color, like the gedit editor and Windows. So if anyone ask, that's my story and I am sticking to it!</p>

<p>Now on to checking my program and to see Flask in action. Drum roll please ...</p>

Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at <code>&lt;your blog URL&gt;/ghost/</code>. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!</p>

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Ghost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!</p>

<p>Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use <em>shortcuts</em> to <strong>style</strong> your content. For example, a list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Item number one</li>
<li>Item number two
<ul><li>A nested item</li></ul></li>
<li>A final item</li>
</ul>

<p>or with numbers!</p>

<ol>
<li>Remember to buy some milk  </li>
<li>Drink the milk  </li>
<li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="links">Links</h3>

<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like <a href='http://ghost.org/' >http://ghost.org</a> - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to <a href='http://ghost.org/' >the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>

<h3 id="whataboutimages">What about Images?</h3>

<p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:</p>

<p><img src='https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png'  alt="The Ghost Logo" /></p>

<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:</p>

<h3 id="quoting">Quoting</h3>

<p>Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="workingwithcode">Working with Code</h3>

<p>Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.</p>

<pre><code>.awesome-thing {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="readyforabreak">Ready for a Break?</h3>

<p>Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="advancedusage">Advanced Usage</h3>

<p>There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can  write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.</p>

<p><input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!" /></p>

<p>That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/welcome-to-ghost/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">40f93309-6bde-4aac-8711-34e7678a7161</guid><category><![CDATA[Getting Started]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[T.Chin]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2014 05:44:04 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
