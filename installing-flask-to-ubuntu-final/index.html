            <section class="post-content">
                <p>Even after my previous install and its many errors I decided to continue right along to the next logical step which is to look for the basic <em>Hello World</em> application to test my Flask install.</p>

<p>I went to the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/quickstart/#deploying-to-a-web-server">Quickstart page of Flask</a> and there I found the directions for my first App.</p>

<pre><code>from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, they did not quite tell me how to go about making the file since the documentation was not written for novices.</p>

<p>I remember trying to create a file in Linux a while back and it said use <em>"touch"</em> to create an empty file, so I did that and named it hello.py as it said in the instructions. Then I used <em>"pico"</em> to edit the file and typed the above code. Now it was time for me to run the code to test my Flask installation. And ...</p>

<p>Yikes!! I am getting errors. Is it because Flask did not install correctly or did I make a typo in my python file? Here is what I typed into my python file.</p>

<p>Does it look like what is typed in the code above? Well apparently I did think it was correct because I dismissed it and went on to make other decisions in trying to find out how to fix the Flask install.</p>

<p>To make a long story shorter ... there is a saying that goes like this:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A drowning man with catch at straw ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was drowning in a sea of coding ignorance and I was catching at straws ... anything to pull me out of the pit I was in, so I began looking for solutions to my <em>Flask</em> problems. </p>

<p>I was running Python 2.7.4, so I said that was my problem and upgraded to 2.7.6. Since Python was not up-to-date, maybe <em>Flask</em> did not install correctly. Went to re-install <em>Virtualenv</em> and was told by the operating system that I already had the newest version installed ... </p>

<p>Okkkk ... then it has to be <em>Flask</em> and I proceeded to re-install that. The operating system told me that the Requirement [was] already satisfied for <em>Flask Werkzeug Jinja2 itsdangerous markupsafe</em> ...say what now? But, my Hello World program was still not working??</p>

<p>So in desperation I decided to take a second look at my <em>Hello World</em> program. Huh! I see a few thing that was not right! I fixed them to arrive at this:</p>

<p>In my defense, I don't do black and white very well: words on a paper, the terminal window ... I live color, like the gedit editor and Windows. So if anyone ask, that's my story and I am sticking to it!</p>

<p>Now on to checking my program and to see Flask in action. Drum roll please ...</p>

                    <p>There isn&#x27;t much to say about me apart from that I love technology. I believe when used the right way they make our lives much easier but used the wrong way you may want to disappear... get my drift?</p>
